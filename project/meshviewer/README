Overview

Requirements
============

MeshViewer version 0.4 requires Vrui version 2.6 build 001 or newer.

Installation Guide
==================

It is recommended to download or move the source packages for Vrui and
MeshViewer into a src directory underneath the user's home directory.
Otherwise, references to ~/src in the following instructions need to be
changed.

It is also recommended to skip optional steps 4 and 6 in the following
instructions. MeshViewer does not need to be installed in order to be
used; installation (to a system directory such as /usr/local) is only
recommended if MeshViewer will be used from multiple user accounts.

0. Install Vrui from ~/src/Vrui-<version>-<build> (see Vrui README file).

1. Change into ~/src directory and unpack the MeshViewer tarball:
   > cd ~/src
   > tar xfz <download path>/MeshViewer-<version>.tar.gz
   - or -
   > tar xf <download path>/MeshViewer-<version>.tar

2. Change into the MeshViewer base directory:
   > cd MeshViewer-<version>

3. If the Vrui version installed in step 0 was not 2.6, or Vrui's
   installation directory was changed from the default of ~/Vrui-2.6,
   adapt the makefile using a text editor. Change the value of
   VRUI_MAKEDIR close to the beginning of the file as follows:
   VRUI_MAKEDIR := <Vrui install dir>/share/make
   Where <Vrui install dir> is the installation directory chosen in
   step 0. Use $(HOME) to refer to the user's home directory instead
   of ~.

4. Optional: Adapt makefile if MeshViewer is to be installed in a
   different location, for example /usr/local. Set INSTALLDIR to the
   desired target location. MeshViewer will then be installed in
   <INSTALLDIR>/bin (where <INSTALLDIR> is the value of INSTALLDIR set
   in the makefile).

5. Build MeshViewer:
   > make
   This creates the MeshViewer executables in ./bin.

6. Optional: Install MeshViewer in the selected target location. This is
   only necessary if the INSTALLDIR variable in the makefile was
   changed. By default, MeshViewer can be run from its base directory.
   To install:
   > make install
   - or, if the target location is a system directory -
   > sudo make install
   This will copy all executables into <INSTALLDIR>/bin.

7. Optional: Add directory containing the MeshViewer executables (in
   ~/src/MeshViewer-<version>/bin in the default installation, in
   <INSTALLDIR>/bin otherwise) to the user's search path. This allows
   running MeshViewer from any directory. Using csh or tcsh:
   > setenv PATH ${PATH}:~/src/MeshViewer-<version>/bin
   - or -
   > setenv PATH ${PATH}:<INSTALLDIR>/bin
   where <INSTALLDIR> is the target location set in the makefile.
   Using bash:
   > export PATH=${PATH}:~/src/MeshViewer-<version>/bin
   - or -
   > export PATH=${PATH}:<INSTALLDIR>/bin
   These lines can also be added to the user's .cshrc or .bashrc files
   to make the additions persist between logins.

Running MeshViewer
==================

These instructions assume that MeshViewer was installed in its base
directory, (see steps 4 and 6 above).

1. On MacOS X: Start X11. MeshViewer requires a running X server, but,
   if preferred, it can be started from a MacOS X terminal instead of
   xterm.

2. Start MeshViewer by providing the name of a mesh file in one of the
   supported formats:
   > ./bin/MeshViewer <mesh file name>

3. See Vrui documentation on Vrui's basic user interface and how to use
   MeshViewer.
